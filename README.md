# IMGA_cuda
An open source GPU accelerated implementation of the Island Model Genetic Algorithm. You can experiment with different population sizes, parent selection functions, survivor selection functions and other hyper parameters in the files that end with _island.py. Corresponding CPU implementation of Island models is in its designated folder but CPU implementation of the normal GA is present in any '{problemname}.py' file.


## Colab Notebook
The given notebook gives step by step instructions to run the code on Google Colab. Please look at the notebook to understand the implementation and the results.
